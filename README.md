For second, you must pay attention to your pet's life bars.
None of them can reach 0, to avoid this, you must press the buttons at the bottom.
If any reaches 0, you will lose the game and must start again.

Be careful! since the life bar decreases by 2 units, but the buttons only increase
life by 1 unit.

You can observe the image of your pet and analyze its mood.
